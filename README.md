# demo-dl4j
The idea of this repo is to play with deeplearning4j library to use it to clasify some variable stars from a set of images.

TODO

I would like to use this library http://nom-tam-fits.github.io/nom-tam-fits/intro.html from NASA to manage FIT file, but i would let it for the future.
Now i am using converted jpeg files from original .FIT files.
